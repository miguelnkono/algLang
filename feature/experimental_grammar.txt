This is the grammar of our language :


I think having two level of recursivity will help with the recursion in grammar of our language.
So we'll have a recurse in the header bloc level and the body bloc of the algorithm itself.

program             -> headerstatement | EOF ;
headerstatement     -> namestatement | variablestatement ;
namestatement       -> "Algorithm: " IDENTIFIER ";" ;
variablestatement   -> "Variables: " statement ;

statement       -> varStmt | exprStmt | printStmt ;
exprStmt        -> expr ";" ;
printStmt       -> "Ecrire (" expr ");" ;
expr            -> equality ;
equality        -> comparison (("!=" | "==") comparison)* ;
comparison      -> term ((">" | ">=" | "<" | "<=") term)* ;
term            -> factory (("+"| "-") factor)* ;
factor          -> unary (("/"| "*") unary)* ;
unary           -> ("!"| "-") unary | primary ;
primary         -> NUMBER | STRING | "vrai" | "faux" | "nil" | "(" expr ")" ;


algoStmt        -> "Algorithme :" declaration ;
